The Spin CLI offers a command to deploy a spin application to the Hippo platform.

## Deploying Spin applications to Hippo

[Hippo](https://github.com/deislabs/hippo) is a Platform as a Service (PaaS) for running WebAssembly applications. Recently,
Hippo has added support for scheduling WebAssembly modules on Nomad using Spin. The
`spin deploy` command is an experimental command for deploying Spin applications to
Hippo locally or in the cloud. This document provides guidance for how to get set up
locally. Documentation on how to get set up to deploy to the cloud using `spin deploy` is
coming soon.

### Pre-requisites

- [Spin](https://github.com/fermyon/spin/releases)
- [Hippo CLI latest](https://github.com/deislabs/hippo-cli)
- [Bindle v0.8.0](https://github.com/deislabs/bindle/releases/tag/v0.8.0)
- [Nomad >= v1.2.6](https://www.nomadproject.io/)
- [Consul >= v1.11.3](https://www.consul.io/)
- [Vault >= v1.9.3](https://www.vaultproject.io/)
- [Traefik >= 2.6.1](https://github.com/traefik/traefik/releases)
- [Dotnet 6.0 CLI](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download)

### Getting Set Up

Start Nomad, Consul, and Traefik using the `run_servers.sh` script from the [nomad-local-demo repo](https://github.com/fermyon/nomad-local-demo).

```
$ git clone git@github.com:fermyon/nomad-local-demo.git
$ cd nomad-local-demo
$ # you can either checkout this commit or if using HEAD, comment out the Hippo job in the
$ #     run_servers.sh script
$ git checkout 64cf9334528f1975d7cbff207997d83cee4f19c2
$ ./run_servers.sh
```

Clone the Hippo repo locally. The Hippo commit this doc was tested at is `2a659c11ffc260a552f71fb3dba791916d4e064a`. Set the `BINDLE_URL` environment variable from the `run_servers.sh` script. Run the `dotnet clean && dotnet build` command to build the project. Change into the `src/Web` directory and use `dotnet run` to run the project.

```
$ git clone git@github.com:deislabs/hippo.git
$ cd hippo
$ export BINDLE_URL=http://bindle.local.fermyon.link:8088/v1
$ dotnet clean && dotnet build
$ cd src/Web
$ dotnet run \
  --Scheduler:Driver=nomad \
  --Bindle:Url="${BINDLE_URL}"
```

Check that the Hippo platform is running by making sure you see the hippo dashboard in the browser at https://localhost:5309.

Register an account in Hippo using the Hippo CLI.

```
$ export HIPPO_URL=http://hippo.local.fermyon.link:8088
$ export HIPPO_USERNAME=user
$ export HIPPO_PASSWORD='PassW0rd!'

$ hippo register
```

### Deploy the example http-rust app

Clone the [Spin repo](https://github.com/fermyon/spin) to ensure you have the examples locally. Make sure that the http-rust example is built before deploying.

```
$ git clone git@github.com:fermyon/spin.git
$ cd spin/examples/http-rust
$ spin build
```

Then, use `spin deploy` to deploy the app to Hippo. This command uses the `BINDLE_URL`, `HIPPO_URL`, `HIPPO_USERNAME` and `HIPPO_PASSWORD` environment
variables that you've set above. _Note: you can also use flags to configure spin deploy_

```
$ spin deploy
```

The spin deploy command packages the application and pushes it to the bindle registry, creates a new app in Hippo and a new channel that the runs the application.

### Test the app

In the future, spin deploy will give the user a domain to hit for the running app. In the meantime, find the IP address and port for the running app in the Hippo
App dashboard at https://localhost:5309.

The app's URL will be displayed under the corresponding channel(s) on the Application page for the `spin-hello-world` example.

You can now test the application and hit the `/hello` route to see `Hello Fermyon!`.

```
$ curl http://spin-hello-world.hippo.local.fermyon.link:8088/hello
Hello, Fermyon!
```
